CSV File Renamer
----------------

A basic program for renaming files in bulk from the command line using a csv file. It manipulates a csv into a series of hashes using the first row as the headers.

This is pretty much the first reasonably useful thing I wrote in Ruby - actually in any language come to think of it.
The goal was to be able to rewrite the titles of a series of badly named files using the data from a csv file. It's all run from the command line and is reasonably clever for what it was - you could change the seperator between fields, the order, whch fields were used.

Not rocket science but a good learning exercise.
